**Introduction To HTML:**
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, serves as the backbone of web pages, providing the structure and organization for content. It's a markup language composed of various elements that browsers interpret to display web pages. Here's a theoretical breakdown:

1. **Elements**: HTML documents are built using elements, which are enclosed within angle brackets. Elements consist of opening tags, content, and closing tags. For instance, `<p>` indicates the start of a paragraph, while `</p>` marks its end.

2. **Tags**: Tags are the fundamental building blocks of HTML. They denote different parts of the content and instruct the browser on how to present them. Tags can be self-closing, like `<img>` for images, or they can have opening and closing parts, like `<p>` for paragraphs.

3. **Attributes**: HTML elements can possess attributes, which provide additional information about the element. Attributes are specified within the opening tag and come in name-value pairs. For instance, the `<a>` tag (anchor) utilizes the `href` attribute to specify the URL of the link.

4. **Document Structure**: HTML documents adhere to a specific structure. They commence with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the `<html>` element, containing two main sections: `<head>` and `<body>`. The `<head>` section encompasses meta-information such as the title and character encoding, while the `<body>` section contains the visible content of the page.

5. **Semantic Elements**: HTML5 introduced semantic elements that provide meaning to content, aiding search engines and accessibility tools in understanding the structure of the page. Examples include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`, each serving a distinct purpose in organizing content.

By utilizing these fundamental components, web developers craft HTML documents that browsers interpret and render into the visual web pages users interact with.
